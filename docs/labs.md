# Labs Overview

Each lab adds new functionality to the API.  A simple e-commerce web application (Github repository [here](https://github.com/thejcfactor/cb-dev-days-web)) accompanies the labs and has all the necessary hooks in place to use the API.  Each time new functionality is added to the API (i.e. after a lab is completed), the corresponding functionality is "unlocked" in web application.  Participants can use the web application to verify the functionality.  A *SwaggerUI* page is also provided if that is a preferred with to test/work with the API.

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT**:exclamation:<br> Each lab contains sections marked with IMPORTANT, REMEMBER, NOTES and DOCUMENTATION.  Please be sure to read each section as it will contain important information related to the lab.

# Prerequisites
1. *Git*
    - Used to clone code repositories
2. *Docker*
    - *Docker* containers have been published for the API and web UI projects.  The labs assume participants are using the published containers.  However, all of the code can be run locally.
