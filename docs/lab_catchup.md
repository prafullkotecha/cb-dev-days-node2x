# Lab Catchup

## Overview
A catchup script is provided so that participants can move between labs.  If the catchup script is run, the *repository.js* file will be overwritten and any previous work will be lost.

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT:** If running in a Windows environment, use *Git Bash* as the catchup script is a bash script.  Alternatively, manual steps can be followed to move between labs.
