# Project Overview
This project is a Node.js API that demonstrates some of the capabilities of Couchbase.  It was built for Developer track of the Couchbase NoSQL Summit and works in conjuction with a Web UI (Github repository [here](https://github.com/thejcfactor/cb-dev-days-web)).  The API is built using the Couchbase 2.x node.js SDK (SDK documentation [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/nodejs-sdk/2.6/start-using-sdk.html)).  The project contains a handful of labs that allow participants to build out the functionality of the simple e-commerce web UI.  The details of each lab are listed below.
